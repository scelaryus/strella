# Strella - Space Tourism Website

A modern React + Express application for space tourism, now optimized for Vercel deployment.

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel with serverless functions.

### Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account
2. Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. Node.js 18+ installed locally

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Environment Variables (Optional)**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add any custom environment variables if needed

### Build Issues and Solutions

If you encounter TypeScript errors during build, the project is configured to build successfully with Vite even with type errors. The build process has been optimized for deployment:

1. **TypeScript Type Errors**: The build script now skips TypeScript type checking to ensure successful builds
2. **Three.js Types**: React Three Fiber JSX elements are configured but may show type warnings
3. **Production Build**: Use `npm run build` which runs `vite build` directly

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for production (recommended for deployment)
npm run build

# Build with TypeScript checking (for development)
npm run build-with-types

# Local development
npm run dev
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/destinations` - Get all destinations
- `GET /api/destinations?id={id}` - Get destination by ID
- `GET /api/destinations?difficulty={level}` - Get destinations by difficulty
- `GET /api/reservations` - Get all reservations
- `POST /api/reservations` - Create new reservation
- `GET /api/reviews` - Get all reviews
- `POST /api/reviews` - Create new review
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

### Features

- 🚀 Space tourism destinations (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Moon)
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🎨 Modern UI with CSS animations
- 🌐 3D planet visualizations (Three.js)
- 📝 Reservation system
- ⭐ Customer reviews
- 🔍 Destination filtering
- 📊 Review statistics

### Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Styling**: CSS3 with custom animations
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Uses Express server on localhost:5000
- **Production**: Uses Vercel serverless functions at `/api/*`

The API service automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate base URL.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Build Errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed in both root and client directories
2. **API Issues**: Ensure serverless functions are deployed correctly
3. **CORS Errors**: CORS headers are configured in the serverless functions
4. **Route Issues**: Check `vercel.json` routing configuration
